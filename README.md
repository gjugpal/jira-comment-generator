## Synopsis
Here is a quick demonstration on how you can generate `wiki markdown` as part of your automated test execution which highlights exactly what tests were ran. The markdown can then be pasted into Jira as a comment.

The comment can include as much information as you wish. For the purposes of this demo I included the following;
* The overall number of tests executed
* The overall number of tests passed / failed
* A list of all the tests which were executed and their status
